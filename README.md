> DataProfiling.sql
This file hosts the code used for searching for named columns and a data profiling script.  (Credits for sources included).
> Part1_build.sql
This file was the testing code to build the output for the submission and includes investigation code and testing.  
> Part1.sql
This is the query submitted for Part 1.  It includes queries demonstrating the distribution of patients by postcode and/or gender.
> Part2_build.sql
This is the testing code for Part 2 and looks at each of the requirements and tests my understanding of relationships between tables.
> Part2.sql
This is the final version but with some options disabled.  My code could not identify the medication/drug requirements in a way that
returned any results so this file opened up the data to the top 5 postcode (outbound) and removed the constraint on medication/drugs.
> Part2_final.sql
This is the query submitted for Part2.  It returns zero records due to the medication constraint as I have implemented it.
